               ARGUMENT PASSING
               ================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.
No new declaration in struct or global/static variable while implementing argument passing.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?
1. argument parsing
I parsed the command line by using for loop and strtok_r. In string.c, you can find example usage of strtok_r() in for loop. 
for (token = strtok_r (fn_copy, " ", &save_ptr); token != NULL;
        token = strtok_r (NULL, " ", &save_ptr)) {
    cmd[argc] = token;
    argc++;
}
By declaring char *cmd[64] and int argc = 0 I  stored parsed token in cmd[argc] while increasing argc by one in every loop.

2. elements of argv[]
I declared char **argv and use malloc to argv = (char **)malloc(sizeof(char *) * argc) and then freed it after the setting up the stack is done.
The implementation/algorithm thoroughly followed the Pintos manual 3.5.1. I used for loops to construct the argv[] in each part as follow.
/* argv[i][...] */
for (i = argc - 1; i >= 0; i --) {
  int len = strlen(cmd[i]) + 1;
  if_.esp -= len;
  memcpy(if_.esp, cmd[i], len);
  argv[i] = (char *)if_.esp;
}

/* word-align & NULL */
int align = (unsigned int)if_.esp % 4;
if_.esp -= align;
memset(if_.esp, 0, align);
if_.esp -= 4;
*(char *)if_.esp = 0;
    
/* argv[i] */
for (i = argc - 1; i >= 0; i --) {
  if_.esp -= 4;
  memcpy(if_.esp, &argv[i], 4);
}

/* address of argv */
if_.esp -= 4;
*(uint32_t *)if_.esp = if_.esp + 4;

/* argc */
if_.esp -= 4;
*(uint32_t *)if_.esp = argc;
    
/* return address */
if_.esp -= 4;
*(uint32_t *)if_.esp = 0;
If first argument(cmd[0] here) is successfully loaded in start_process(), than it starts to construct the argv[]. Otherwise, is exits the thread.

3. avoid overflowing the stack page
I used is_user_vaddr(address) in "threads/vaddr.h" to avoid the overflow. I made void check(const void *address) to check if the address overflow the stack page.
After checking the addresses are available in each cases in the syscall, the arguments are passed to the implemented syscall function.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?
It's because strtok_r() is safer for threaded program. According to the strtok() in string library, it passes global data static char *olds to __strtok_r().
char *
strtok (char *s, const char *delim)
{
    static char *olds;
    return __strtok_r (s, delim, &olds);
}
Since global variable can be accessed by other threads, it could be unsafe in threaded programs.
In contrast, strtok_r() receives char **save_ptr as an argument, so it is safe in threaded programs.

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.
Separating commands in shell can be safer than in kernel.
And it is more efficient since it reduces the workload in kernel and reducing time kernel is running.

                 ============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.
// in threads/thread.h
#ifdef USERPROG
    /* Owned by userprog/process.c. */
    uint32_t *pagedir;                  /* Page directory. */
    struct file *files[128];            /* NEW!! Pointer to the file struct, for file descriptor. */
    int fd;                             /* NEW!! int fd; value for file descriptor. */
#endif

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?
A file descriptor is an abstract value used when a process accesses a specific file, and has an integer value other than 0.
When a process opens a file, the smallest unused file descriptor of that process is assigned.
Then, when the process accesses the open file, it refers to the file using the file descriptor value.
When file is closed file descriptor is freed(NULL).
File descriptors are unique within a single process.
